Repo for Technical Indicator Visualizations

See `Crypto Ind c8875.md` for explanation of indicators.

We are looking to create a javascript app that allows users to pick a crypto currency or stock and see each of the charts.  
We'll start with Crypto for now.  

There should be 4 charts for each indicator:
1. Current Price and Moving Average
2. RSI
3. ADX
4. Combined Chart

There should be a selection box to select a crypto currency which then updates all the charts.
All necessary data is in the `data/chart_data.csv` file.  

Our preferred color pallet included in `data/color_pallet.csv`.  

The examples given are more intricate than our desired final product.  
Overall the visuals should be easy to understand, and not overly busy as these are consumer facing charts.  
There is a mock up of a similar app in `MockUp.pdf` as a rough style guide.
