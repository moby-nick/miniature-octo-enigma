# Crypto Technical Indicator Introduction

In today‚Äôs post we are going to introduce something called ‚Äútechnical indicators‚Äù. These indicators can be used to help inform our investment decisions in both crypto and stocks. **Technical Indicator** is a bit of a loaded term, so let‚Äôs break it down further.

In general, an **Indicator** is some value that gives us an idea of what is happening in the market or what might happen in the future. There are a many types of indicators, but we tend to focus on a few in finance: Technical, Fundamental, Economic, and Sentiment.

A **Technical Indicator** is, unsurprisingly, based on **Market Technicals**. **Market Technicals** are aspects of financial markets we can see every day. In practice, this is primarily changes in the number of shares traded and changes in price.

So together a Technical Indicator is a value that helps us understand what is going on in the stock or crypto markets, and can give us an idea of what to expect in the future.

**Why would we use technical indicators?**

We use **Technical Indicators** to help us understand characteristics of the short term trend in the price of an asset. This helps us answer the question: ‚ÄúWill Bitcoin increase in price over the next month?‚Äù with some level of confidence.

We will walk through a number of Technical Indicators on Bitcoin, and consider how would use them when trading crypto currencies. 

The first indicator we‚Äôre going to focus in on today is üëá 

## The Relative Strength Index Indicator

Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a technical indicator used to determine if an asset is **oversold** or **overbought**. 

**Oversold** means an asset‚Äôs price has fallen too quickly, and is likely to reverse direction. 

Conversely, **Overbought** means an asset‚Äôs price has risen too quickly relative to its current trend and is likely to come down a bit. 

The reason we use the RSI is to figure out if an asset is oversold or overbought. The RSI is on a scale of 100, with a value over 70 indicating Overbought, and a value less than 30 indicating Oversold. Anything above 50 is a positive trend, and anything below 50 is a downward trend. We can also look at the trend of the RSI to see if it‚Äôs heading towards overbought or oversold and strike preemptively.

Let‚Äôs look at the RSI for Bitcoin over the last year. We‚Äôve marked the overbought range as red (likely to go back down), and the oversold (likely to go back up) as green. We have also added a line at 50, to partition when the trend is positive or negative. 

We can see that Bitcoin became Overbought in late September 2021, then fell considerably. The RSI informs us Bitcoin was Oversold in January 2022, and has now climbed significantly the last few months. The current reading of the Bitcoin RSI shows a positive trend, but not Oversold, giving us confidence in its continued steady climb.

**Soon we‚Äôll be releasing these as interactive charts on our platform so that you can see the lines move in real time!**

## The 2nd Indicator: Moving Average

A Moving Average indicator is exactly what it sounds like, it is the average of the price of an asset over a set number of days. 

We can use it to confirm trends in price or to look for divergences from that trend. For example, we can take the average over the last 30 days of an asset price and compare it to today‚Äôs price to confirm a trend. If the current price is close to the 30 day moving average, then we can be confident that the asset is still inline with that trend. But, if the current price is far off from the 30-day moving average, then the trend might be broken, and we would want to reassess what we think the trend and direction of the trend might be. 

In practice, longer-term trends like the 30, 50, or 200-day Moving Average, also act as **Levels of Support** or **Levels of Resistance,** depending on where the current price is relative to that indicator. A Level of Support is a price that we believe will act as a stopping point for a price that is declining. Similarly, a Level of Resistance will act as a stopping or slowing point for a price that is rising. For example, when the current price of an asset is above its 30-day Moving Average but begins to decline, we would look to the 30-day Moving Average as a price where it will begin to stabilize, acting as a level of support. However, if the current price is below its 30-day Moving Average but begins to rise, the 30-day Moving Average is a point where that upward trend might begin to stall or even reverse.

In the chart below, we can see Bitcoin‚Äôs current price against its 30-day Moving Average. Most importantly, the current price is above its 30-day Moving Average, indicating it is in an upward trend. And if the price begins to decline, we will look to the 30-day Moving Average as a Level of Support.

## Average Directional Index

The Average Directional Index (ADX) is a more complex indicator than Moving Average and RSI. What you need to know is that it tells us the strength of a trend by giving a value between 0 and 100. The ADX is usually broken up into Weak Trend/Stalled (ADX between 0-25), Strong Trend (ADX between 25-50), Very Strong Trend (ADX between 50-75), and Extremely Strong Trend (ADX between 75-100). For example, an upward trend of a stock and a high ADX would give you confidence that the trend is strengthening. But an upward trend with a low ADX value means the trend has stalled or losing steam. Or a downward trending price coupled with a low ADX indicates the price is stabilizing, and may soon reverse.

Again using Bitcoin as an example, we can see the ADX has recently exited the Weak Trend/Stalled section (below 25), and now moved into the Strong Trend (25-50). From the previous charts we know Bitcoin is currently in an upward trend, so the ADX‚Äôs current value tells us that trend is strengthening.

## Combining RSI, Moving Average, and ADX

Let‚Äôs take what we‚Äôve learned and think about how we can combine them into our investment strategy. A common strategy objective is to invest in a stock or crypto that has a strong upward trend and to sell before that trend reverses completely.

If we have an upward trending stock price, we‚Äôre off to a good start. We can use the technical indicators to help us understand that trend. First, let‚Äôs look at the RSI: if it is between 50 and 70, and not heading to the overbought territory, then we can have more confidence that the upward trend is sustainable. Next, the 30-day Moving Average will tell us how far off the current price is from its longer-term trend. If we are very far off, even if we are above, we should ask ourselves, ‚ÄúWhat happened to make the price move so much?‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs the new price justified?‚Äù. If the answer is no, or we cannot answer that question with confidence, then the price may revert back to its 30-day Moving Average, acting as a Level of Support. Finally, the ADX will tell us the strength of the trend. If the ADX is increasing then the trend in the price is getting increasingly stronger. If the ADX is declining and there is still an upward trending price, then we shouldn‚Äôt expect the price to continue climbing at the same rate.

Cool, now we know how to assess an upward trend‚Äôs strength and sustainability. So when do we know the party‚Äôs over? If the trend is still increasing, but the RSI is well into its overbought territory, the price is way above its Moving Average, and the ADX is declining (meaning the trend is weakening), then we will want to reduce our position size or sell altogether until conditions improve.

**Bitcoin Combined Indicators**

As a final example, let‚Äôs quickly go through how we would apply these indicators in combination to Bitcoin. 

A current price above its **30-day Moving Average** but not too far off, indicates a positive sustainable trend and a level of support that isn‚Äôt too far off, in case we see a temporary decline. 

![Untitled](Crypto%20Ind%20c8875/Untitled%201.png)

An **RSI** above 50 (positive trend), but not over 75 (which would be Overbought), similarly indicates a strong and sustainable positive trend.

![Untitled](Crypto%20Ind%20c8875/Untitled.png)

Finally, a climbing ADX indicates the positive trend we identified with our other indicators is strengthening after a period of weak trend/stalling.

While the Technical Indicators on Bitcoin look good at this point, we should take them in context of the longer term trends and qualitative analysis on Bitcoin.

As a final note, technical indicators should be used with caution. They are great at spotting trends and helping us determine entry and exit points for our trades, but they are not a replacement for narrative based qualitative analysis. Many of the rules mentioned above such as RSI levels (70 and 30) and using a 30 day moving average have come from decades of use by traders. They are general benchmarks for these indicators but are not absolute rules.

**What do we do when indicators disagree?**

Sometimes one indicator will tell us to buy while another tells us to sell for the same asset. Mixed signals might mean we are in for some volatility, which isn‚Äôt unfamiliar to crypto investors. We want to consider how strong each of the mixed signals are as well. If we have a weak bearish signal from one indicator at the same time we have strong bullish signal from another indicator, then we will probably want to stay invested. We should, however, keep an eye on our investment if conditions deteriorate.

We hope you have enjoyed our tour of Technical Indicators. Check out our top crypto picks based on Technical Indicators below:

# Our Technical Indicator Crypto Picks

For each of our picks we have condensed the three indicators down into a single chart for easier viewing. The current price (blue) and Moving Average (orange) use the left hand side y scale, and the RSI (purple) and ADX (grey) use the right hand side y scale. RSI and ADX are both from 0 to 100, so they can easily share a y scale. This reinforces the idea that we always want to look at Technical Indicators in combination.

**AVAXUSD - Avalanche**

- Current price (blue) is above its 30-day Moving Average (orange), indicating an upward trend. However the current price is starting to get away from the Moving Average, indicating a potential risk if there is a drawdown - there is a long way to fall before it finds a level of support.
- RSI (purple) is between 50 and 70, indicating an upward trend but not overbought. RSI is also increasing over the last 30 days, indicating this upward trend is likely to continue
- ADX (grey) is solidly in the Strong Trend range (25-50), indicating the rate of the upward trend is likely to continue

**LINKUSD - Chainlink**

- A steadily increasing price (blue), but not far from its 30-day Moving Average (orange) indicates a sustainable upward trend
- RSI (purple) steadily climbing over 50, indicating a positive trend, but not yet Overbought (75) also indicates a sustainable upward trend
- ADX (grey) is just below 25, indicating it is currently in a weak trend, but is heading towards the 25-50 range, indicating a strong trend. This indicates the upward trend will likely continue and price will even increase at a faster rate
